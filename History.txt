Accidentally reintroduced <%- in the roles' edit template.

=== 8.0.0 / 2010-04-12

* Rethought roles/rights.  Made it much simpler.  Motivation is that 'roles are meaningless without rights'.  So rights appear as read-only in the roles' show view and as check-box selections in the roles' edit view.

Fine tuning the roles/rights routes.

=== 7.0.0 / 2010-04-09
