= CoreAuth

== Description:

Simple user authentication and role-based authorization.

A frequently recurring task in writing a new web application is creating a role-based auth system to form the basis for access control in the application.  The tasks of creating such a system are extracted in this generator.

== Features/Problems:

* Rails 3 compliant.

* The protected area comprises of a system section (where CoreAuth is controlled and should only
  be managed by a root account-style user) and an admin section where application administrators
  can control the application.
  
  Example: Managing users, roles, and rights (CoreAuth actions) are under system.  Managing
  application specific actions, like new/edit/delete comments, etc. are under admin.
  
  System and Admin are presented under separate paths in the views and separate controllers so
  they are easier to administrate.
  
* Two layouts are defined: site.html.erb and admin.html.erb (with respective .css files).
  site.html.erb is the public layout and invoked in the application controller.
  admin.html.erb is the admin layout and invoked in the CoreAuth controllers.
